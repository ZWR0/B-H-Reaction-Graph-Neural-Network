# B-H Reaction Graph Neural Network
This repository contains the implementation of BH-RGNN (Buchwald-Hartwig Reaction Graph Neural Network), a novel graph neural network model designed to predict yields in Buchwald-Hartwig (B–H) reactions by modeling complex interactions among chemical components.

## Model Overview
BH-RGNN introduces a custom-designed reaction graph structure, where each reactant is represented as an individual node. This architecture enables the model to capture both intramolecular and intermolecular relationships within the reaction system, offering a more comprehensive representation of the chemical environment. The model is trained on a high-throughput B–H reaction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with relatively low computational cost.

## Key Insights
Through perturbation-based analysis, BH-RGNN uncovers critical insights into how bases influence reaction yields. The model identifies key features of bases that significantly affect outcomes, providing practical guidance for base selection in experimental design.
